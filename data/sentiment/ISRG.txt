3. **Competitive Threats:** Large medtech players are investing heavily in robotic platforms, which could erode ISRG's dominance, especially outside the US.
4. **Litigation and Regulatory Risks:** Ongoing patent/IP challenges and global regulatory pressures, especially in price-sensitive markets, threaten margins and expansion.
5. **Dependence on Procedure Volume:** Revenues are increasingly tied to recurring procedure volume; any slowdown from economic or healthcare policy changes would hurt results.
