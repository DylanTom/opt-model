## Key Insights

### **Positives**
#### 1. **Strategic Shift Yields Results**
- onsemi’s pivot to high-growth, high-margin segments like automotive (especially electric vehicles), industrial automation, and advanced power management chips is helping sustain higher-than-typical industry margins.
- Automotive sales are now over 50% of total revenue.

#### 2. **Strong Margins**
- Gross margin remains robust at nearly 46%, benefiting from a focus on premium, differentiated products.

#### 3. **Solid Balance Sheet**
- Onsemi maintains strong liquidity, with cash access well above near-term obligations.
- Capex remains disciplined, allowing free cash flows to stay positive.

#### 4. **Strong Position in Megatrend Markets**
- Exposure to structural growth trends (EVs, ADAS, solar, energy storage) gives onsemi a long-term tailwind.
- Strategic customer wins with leading global automakers position the company well for future growth.

#### 5. **Ongoing Cost Control**
- SG&A and R&D costs are well managed; operating leverage is a highlight as revenue grows.

### **Negatives**
#### 1. **Quarterly Revenue Decline**
- Revenue dropped 4% YoY, and net income decreased by 25% due to softening end markets, especially in consumer and some industrial segments.

#### 2. **Mixed Guidance & Macroeconomic Risks**
- For Q2 2024, management guided another sequential revenue decline. Visibility remains low in certain segments due to excess inventory and global economic uncertainty (notably in China and EU).
- Possible prolonged destocking cycles could weigh on near-term results.

#### 3. **Dependence on Automotive Growth**
- Over-concentration in EV and auto exposures introduces cyclical risk if that segment slows, as seen in recent sector volatility.

#### 4. **Capital Intensity**
- Large investments in new SiC (Silicon Carbide) capacity and technology could pressure cash flows if sales ramp slower than expected.
- Competition in SiC is increasing (STMicro, Wolfspeed, etc.), potentially impacting pricing power.

#### 5. **Geopolitical and Supply Chain Risks**
- Like the rest of the semiconductor industry, ON is exposed to global supply chain issues and policy risks, especially regarding China.
