## Key Insights

### Positives

1. **Consistent Revenue Growth:** Salesforce continues to expand its top line, demonstrating resilience in a soft enterprise IT spending environment.
2. **Improved Profitability:** Operating margin and net income have increased significantly due to cost-cutting measures and slower headcount growth.
3. **Strong Free Cash Flow:** The company’s FCF remains robust, supporting continued investments, share repurchases, and debt reduction.
