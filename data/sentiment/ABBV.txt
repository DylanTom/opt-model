- **Debt Load:** AbbVie has a large debt ($61B as of March 2024, post-Allergan acquisition); although manageable, it limits financial flexibility.

### Summary

AbbVie faces a transitional period as Humira, historically the world's top-selling drug, is significantly impacted by biosimilar competition. The company, however, has so far managed the transition better than many peers, thanks to fast-growing replacements (Skyrizi, Rinvoq) and continued innovation. Financials in 2024 show short-term pressure on revenues and margins, but the outlook is helped by a strong portfolio, quality pipeline, and a strategic focus on high-value therapeutic areas. The biggest risks are declining legacy revenue and high debt, which require careful management in the years ahead.

**Overall, AbbVie remains a resilient player in the pharmaceutical industry, balancing challenges with a promising pipeline and shareholder-friendly policies.**
