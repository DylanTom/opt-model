## **Negatives / Risks**

- **Competition:** Intensifying from Amazon Prime, Disney+, Apple TV+, and others—some of which are integrated with larger media or tech ecosystems.
- **Saturation in Key Markets:** North America and Western Europe show signs of saturation, slowing growth prospects in mature markets.
- **Churn Impact:** Ongoing price hikes and password-sharing enforcement could increase churn or lower customer satisfaction.

## **Sentiment Summary**

- **Overall Sentiment:** ***Moderately Positive***
- Netflix is in a strong position, regaining momentum on subscriber and revenue growth. Strategic pivots (advertising, anti-sharing, live content) are working, and the business has rebounded strongly on profitability. However, content costs, competition, and market saturation risks remain. Long term, sustaining double-digit growth will depend on engagement, innovation, and global expansion.
