**Negatives:**

- **Cost Inflation:** Significant impact from higher input costs, especially cocoa and packaging, which could pressure margins if not offset by price increases or productivity.
- **Geopolitical Risk:** Continued exposure to unstable regions (notably Russia, some Middle Eastern and African markets).
- **Category Maturity:** Saturation in some product categories (e.g., chocolate and biscuits in North America/Europe) limits growth opportunities.
- **Currency Volatility:** International operations expose the company to significant FX risk.

**Sentiment Analysis & Outlook:**

- **Fair/Neutral-to-Positive:** Mondelez remains a solid defensive play in the consumer staples sector, supported by market-leading brands, pricing power, and geographic diversity. Near-term challenges center mainly on inflationary pressures and geopolitical exposure, but strong cash flow and consistent execution position the company well for modest growth and continued shareholder returns.
