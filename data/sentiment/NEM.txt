### **Key News and Developments**
**Newcrest Acquisition:** The integration of Newcrest Mining—completed in late 2023—has doubled Newmont’s gold production, making it the dominant global player. However, the integration has presented logistical and cultural challenges.

**Guidance:** For 2024, Newmont expects to produce 6.9 to 7.3 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,350 to $1,450 per ounce, up from prior guidance due to inflation and operational issues.

**Operational Challenges:** The company faced temporary disruptions at several mines due to weather, safety stoppages, and cost overruns, notably at Penasquito (Mexico) and Boddington (Australia).

**ESG Focus:** Newmont continues to be a sector leader in sustainability, emphasizing decarbonization, safety, and Indigenous relations.
