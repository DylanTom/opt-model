   - BlackRock raised its quarterly dividend to $5.10/share (annualized yield ~2.5%) and continues to repurchase shares.

#### Negatives

   - Increasing competition in ETFs and index funds is pressuring management fees. BlackRock’s average net fee rate declined slightly YoY.
2. **Geopolitical Exposures:**  
   - Ongoing tensions between the US and China, and war in Ukraine, pose risks to international business, including regulatory scrutiny over Chinese partnerships.
3. **ESG Backlash:**  
   - Some US states are pulling pension mandates due to BlackRock’s stance on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing, resulting in minor but publicized asset outflows. 
4. **Market Dependency:**  
   - As a pure asset manager, BlackRock’s revenues are sensitive to global capital market conditions and investor confidence. Prolonged market downturns would impact earnings.
